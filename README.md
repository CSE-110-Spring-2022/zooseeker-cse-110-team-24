# *San Diego ZooSeeker*

**San Diego ZooSeeker** is an Android app that allows users to plan a trip and navigate exhibits in shortest distances in San Diego Zoo. 

## User Stories
This is a quarter-long class project of UCSD CSE110-Software Engineering. User stories are collected from our client who had unsatisfying experience with the [San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seamgen.sandiegozoo.zoo&hl=en_US&gl=US). 
* **Search & Add**: Users can search for animal exhibits by tags, and add them to the trip planner. 
* **Shortest Route Generator**: Users can view a shortest route through exhibits they choose.
* **Navigation**: Users can get directions forward and backward from one exhibit to another. 
* **Off-track reminder**: Users are reminded if they are off-track and given the option to replan by regenerating shortest route.
