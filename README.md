# Project 3 - *San Diego ZooSeeker*

**San Diego ZooSeeker** is an Android app that allows users to plan a trip and navigate exhibits in shortest distances in San Diego Zoo. 

## User Stories
The user stories are collected from our client who had unsatisfying experience with the [San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seamgen.sandiegozoo.zoo&hl=en_US&gl=US). 
* **Search & Add**: Users are able to search for animal exhibits by tags, and add them to trip planner. 
* **Shortest Route**: A shortest route through the user's chosen exhibits is computed
